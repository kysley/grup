# grup

### Grup is a social link aggregator (reddit/hn) that is a work in progress

##### Runs on node and express, using MongoDB and Mongoose for database

The UI is pretty much non-existant at this stage while I polish the functionality and routing.

You could learn from this (probably, if you wanted) as I believe the code is pretty lean.

# TODO
You can keep up-to-date with the development of Grup on [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/Grup-db66c03ba4fb496e987048cd3811627d)
