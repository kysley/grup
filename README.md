# grup

### Grup is a work in progress social link aggregator (reddit/hn).

##### Runs on node and express, using MongoDB and Mongoose for database

The UI is designed to be very (VERY) retro, this may change in the future.

You could learn from this (probably, if you wanted) as I believe the code is pretty lean.

# TODO
You can keep up-to-date with the development of Grup on [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/Grup-db66c03ba4fb496e987048cd3811627d)
